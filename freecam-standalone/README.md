# freecam-standalone

This FreeCam mode is taken directly from [BF3RM/MapEditor](https://github.com/BF3RM/MapEditor) so the credit goes to the guys behind that mod.

I just repackaged it in a way that can be used as a standalone develoment tool to allow for easy and fast navigation through the map.

### Usage

* Press `F5` to toggle between first person and free camera
* Press `F6` while in free camera mode in order to move the local player in that position
